## FFY00 (Filipe La√≠ns)

I'm a student and developer. I program everything from low to high level but the one language I love is [D](https://dlang.org). I am also interested in radio systems, infosec and reverse engineering. Finally, I am a [Truster User](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Trusted_Users) at [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org) and a member of the [Aurora Free Open Source Software Organization](https://aurorafoss.org).
