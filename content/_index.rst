Hello, my name is Filipe Laíns and I am an open source developer from Portugal.

I enjoy designing clean and correect solutions to software problems and I am
interested in hardware design, analysis and reverse engineering, however I don't
have any formal education in electrical engineering.

Over the years, I've contributed to several open source projects and eventually
gained maintainership of some of them. Some of the projects I maintain are
`Arch Linux`_, a Linux distribution, where I am a packager, and libratbag_, a
DBus daemon to configure input peripherals. I have also contributed to some
other relevant projects like the `Linux kernel`_, Wireshark_, CPython_ (the
reference implementation of the Python programming language) and meson_.

There are several languages I am proficient at but the main are C and Python_.

If you want to find out more about my work, and what I've been up to lately,
please check my `Github profile`_.
