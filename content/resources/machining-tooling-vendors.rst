    :title: Machining Tooling Vendors
    :summary: List of machining tooling, and my thoughts on them.


This article contains a list of machining tooling vendors, as well as some
commentary about my personal experience and impression of them. I decided
to compile this because it is a bit difficult to find good budget-oriented
options accessible Europe. While this list is not limited to vendors in, or
near, the EU, it is heavily focused on that.


Europe
======


`Knuth <https://www.knuth.com//>`_
----------------------------------

.. list-table::

   * - Quality
     - .. class:: text-rate-5

          High

   * - Cost
     - .. class:: text-rate-3

          Medium

High quality, and pretty good prices. I have bought a surface place and machine
vise from them. The surface plate in particular was an excellent deal for the
specifications.


`Elmag <https://www.elmag.eu/en/>`_
-----------------------------------

.. list-table::

   * - Quality
     - .. class:: text-rate-4

          Medium-High

   * - Cost
     - .. class:: text-rate-2

          Medium-High

Decent quality, and reasonable prices. The sale/clearance section of the shop
sometimes has good deals. I bought my milling machine from their clearance
section, it was a demo unit, but was in decent shape. Together with the milling
machine, I also bought an X axis motor from the sale/clearance section, which
was an excellent deal, and a 4-jaw lathe chuck also from the sale/clearance
section, which also was a pretty good deal.


`cut-tools.eu <https://www.cut-tools.eu/>`_
-------------------------------------------

.. list-table::

   * - Quality
     - .. class:: text-rate-3

          Medium

   * - Cost
     - .. class:: text-rate-4

          Medium-Low

Decent quality, and reasonable prices. I bought an endmill set and bunch of
endmills and other cutting tools. So far, I am pretty happy with the quality.


`CNCdrive <http://shop.cncdrive.com/>`_
---------------------------------------

.. list-table::

   * - Quality
     - .. class:: text-rate-3

          Medium

   * - Cost
     - .. class:: text-rate-4

          Medium-Low

Decent quality, and reasonable prices. I bought a bunch of ER20 chucks and a
ER20 collet set. The chucks and collets seem to be of decent quality.


`Vallder <https://vallder.com/>`_
---------------------------------

.. list-table::

   * - Quality
     - .. class:: text-rate-2

          Medium-Low

   * - Cost
     - .. class:: text-rate-4

          Medium-Low

Okay-ish quality, and reasonable prices. I bought an bunch of ER20 collets and
endmills. The collets were not great, likely chinese imports, I would stay away
from workholding on this vendor, but the endmills and cutting tools seem
reasonable.


`HC Maschinentechnik <https://hc-maschinentechnik.de/>`_
--------------------------------------------------------

.. list-table::

   * - Quality
     - *Unknown*

   * - Cost
     - .. class:: text-rate-4

          Medium-Low

This was recommend to me, but I haven't ordered from them yet, though the prices
seem reasonable.


UK
==


`Arc Euro Trade <https://www.arceurotrade.co.uk>`_
--------------------------------------------------

.. list-table::

   * - Quality
     - .. class:: text-rate-4

          Medium-High

   * - Cost
     - .. class:: text-rate-4

          Medium-Low

Decent quality, and pretty good prices. I bought a bunch of MT2 tool holders, a
fly cutter, a coaxial indicator, and a couple endmills. I am really happy with
the quality for the cost. Unfortunately, it is located in the UK, otherwise it
would probably be my go-to vendor for machining tooling.


US
==


`Tormach <https://tormach.com>`_
--------------------------------------------------

.. list-table::

   * - Quality
     - .. class:: text-rate-5

          High

   * - Cost
     - .. class:: text-rate-2

          Medium-High

High quality, and reasonable prices. I haven't personally ordered from them, but
it has a really good reputation. If my machine had a MT3 spindle, I would
probably be using their TTS system. For folks located in the US or Canada, it is
a really good option.


China
=====


`Aliexpress <https://www.aliexpress.com/>`_
-------------------------------------------

.. list-table::

   * - Quality
     - .. class:: text-rate-1

          Low

   * - Cost
     - .. class:: text-rate-5

          Low

Low quality, and low prices. I would stay away from any tooling that requires
good precision. While it may be possible to find decent-quality sellers, it's
difficult and pretty much a gamble. For anything that doesn't need that much
precision, it can be a great resource. I have bought a bunch of different things
from Aliexpress, but the most relevant items here would be a small rotary table,
a spring-loaded ER20 chuck for tapping, a large set of taps and dies, and a 25mm
micrometer. The rotary table and the micrometer seem decent, the spring-loaded
ER20 chuck isn't great, but since it's only for tapping, it's acceptable, and the
tap and die set also seems decent, but I did a fair bit of research when
selecting it to ensure it was of okay-ish-quality before buying.
