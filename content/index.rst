Hello, my name is Filipe La√≠ns and I am an open source developer from Portugal.

I enjoy designing clean and correct solutions to software problems and I am
interested in hardware design, analysis and reverse engineering, however I don't
have any formal education in electrical engineering.

Over the years, I've contributed to several open source projects and eventually
gained maintainership of some of them. Some of the projects I maintain are
`Arch Linux`_, a Linux distribution, where I am a packager, and libratbag_, a
DBus daemon to configure input peripherals. I have also authored a few projects,
such as `pypa/build`_, a Python package builder, which has been adopted by the
`Python Packaging Authority`_, and `openinput`_, a project that provides
open source firmware, open hardware, and a open protocol, for input devices
(eg. mice, keyboards, etc.). Some relevant projects I have contributed to are
the `Linux kernel`_, Wireshark_, CPython_ (the reference implementation of the
Python programming language) and the `meson`_ build system.

There are several languages I am proficient at but the main are C and Python_.

If you want to find out more about my work, and what I've been up to lately,
please check my `Github profile`_.

In case you want to support my work, I have a `Github sponsors`_ page.
