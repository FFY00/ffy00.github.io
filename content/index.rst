Hello, my name is Filipe Laíns and I am an open source developer from Portugal.

I enjoy designing clean and correct solutions to software problems and I am
interested in hardware design, analysis and reverse engineering, however I don't
have any formal education in electrical engineering.

There are several languages I am proficient at but the main are C and Python_.

Over the years, I've contributed to several open source projects and eventually
gained maintainership of some of them. In addition to this, I have also authored
a few popular projects.

You can find the full list on my `Github Profile`_, but here are some of the
most relevant projects I maintain:


`Arch Linux`_
    A popular Linux distribution, where I am a packager. You can find a list of
    the package I maintain on the `package search page`_.

libratbag_
    A DBus daemon to configure input peripherals.

`pypa/build`_
    A Python package builder which implements `PEP 517`_. The project is
    currently under the umbrella of the `Python Packaging Authority`_.

`openinput`_
    A project that provides open source firmware, open hardware, and a open
    protocol, for input devices (eg. mice, keyboards, etc.).


And some of the most relevant projects I have contributed to:


`Linux`_
    Linux is a one the most popular operating system kernels. I have contributed
    to several device drivers in the USB HID subsystem.

Wireshark_
    Wireshark is the world’s foremost and widely-used network protocol analyzer.
    I have implemented the USB HID report parser.

CPython_
    The reference implementation of the Python programming language. I am
    currently a member of the Python triage team and have contributed many
    miscelaneous things.

`Meson`_
    Meson is a very popular build system. I worked on support for the D
    language.

If you want to find out more about my work, and what I've been up to lately,
please check my `Github profile`_.

In case you want to support my work, I have a `Github sponsors`_ page.
